# WEEK 3 JavasScript

## Exercise3.2


Create 3 simple functions where call, bind and apply are used. 
The intention of this exercise isto understand how they work and their differences.
(0.5 hours)




## What is Bind?

The bind() method creates a new function, when invoked, has the `this` sets to a provided value.

## What is Call?
    
The call() method is similar to bind() but it executes the result method implicitly.

    
## What is Apply?

The apply() method is similar to the call() method except that it takes the arguments of the function as an array instead of the individual arguments.

## Conclusion 
    
- call() and apply() are pretty interchangeable
Just decide whether it’s easier to send in an array or a comma separated list of arguments

- bind() method returns new function, that we can run anywhere we want.
