# Exercise 5.1

Using async/await and Generator create separate functions and achieve the same functionality - 3 hours

Execute 3 callback functions asynchronously, for example 
doTask1(), doTask2(), and doTask3().

## Guildline

- 2 functions should be created. 
- One for Async/Await and the other one for Generators.
- 3rd party libraries should not be used.
- Custom Function should carry a meaningful name.
- The program should execute without errors.
- The program should achieve the desired result.
- The program should take care of all 3 states of a Promise.
- Should be committed to Git with meaningful commit messages.

## Outcome:

- Under the hood understanding of how a Generator works.
- Under the hood understanding of how Async/await works.
